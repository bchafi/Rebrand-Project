        <h1>What is IPTV and How Does It Work?</h1>
        <p>IPTV, or Internet Protocol Television, is a system that delivers television content over the internet instead of traditional cable or satellite formats. It allows users to stream live TV channels, on-demand content, and even record shows for later viewing.</p>
        <h2>How Does IPTV Work?</h2>
        <p>IPTV works by sending video content through internet protocol (IP) packets rather than satellite or cable signals. It requires a broadband internet connection, a compatible device, and access to an IPTV service provider. Viewers can stream content through an IPTV player or app on their smart TV, mobile device, or computer.</p>
        <h2>Types of IPTV Services</h2>
        <p>There are three main types of IPTV services:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Live IPTV:</strong> Streaming live TV channels in real time, similar to traditional TV.</li>
            <li><strong>Time-shifted IPTV:</strong> Allows users to watch shows that aired earlier but are not part of the on-demand library.</li>
            <li><strong>Video on Demand (VOD):</strong> Provides a library of content that can be streamed at any time.</li>
        </ul>
